#pANIto
Given a multi-FASTA alignment, output the genome wide average nucleotide identity (gwANI) for each sample against all other samples. A matrix containing the percentages is outputted. This software loads the whole file into memory.

#Usage
```
   $ panito
   Usage: panito [-hV] <file>
   This program calculates the genome wide ANI for a multiFASTA alignment.
    -h		this help message
    -V		print version and exit
    <file>		input alignment file which can optionally be gzipped
```

##Input format
The input file must be a multi-FASTA file, where all sequences are the same length:

```
   >sample1
   AAAAAAAAAA
   >sample2
   AAAAAAAAAC
   >sample3
   AAAAAAAACC
```

## Output
```
        sample1	    sample2	    sample3
sample1	100.000000	90.00000	80.000000
sample2	-			100.000000	90.000000
sample3	-			-			100.000000
```

#Installation
##OSX/Linux - from source
Ensure you have a standard development environmentinstalled(e.g. gcc, automake, autoconf, libtool). Download the software from GitHub and unzip.

```
autoreconf -i -f
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

##OSX/Linux - Homebrew
```
brew tap tseemann/bioinformatics-linux
brew install panito
```

#Etymology
